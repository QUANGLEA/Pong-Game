# Pong-Game

This project is written with Python 3.9.6

## Summary: 
This is a recreation of the popular Pong Game using Python. I created this game when I was first learning about Python Turtles. 

## Description: 
This is my recreation of a pong game. This game can be played on one computer with two players max. The first player would control the paddle on the left with WASD keys.The second player would control the paddle on the right with up, down, right, left arrow keys. The goal of the game is to not let the ball touches your endzone (where your paddle is). The code allows the user to set their own score limit (the score requires to win).I also included some sound tracks I got from the internet that I did some editing to make the game more interactive.
